# Notebooks

This folder contains exploratory Jupyter notebooks used during experimentation and analysis.

In Phase-1, notebooks may be used for:
- Dataset exploration and visualization
- Preliminary experiments
- Sanity checks during model development

Notebooks are not required for running the final model or inference pipeline and are provided for reference only.
